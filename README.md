In a world where climate change is becoming an increasingly urgent issue, understanding how our planet's temperature has shifted over the decades can offer critical insights. What if we could not only track these changes but also predict the future of our climate?


Context: Climate change is no longer a distant threat; itâ€™s a reality that impacts every corner of the globe. By analyzing historical temperature data, we can uncover patterns and trends that shed light on the extent of these changes. My analysis spans over five decades, from 1970 to 2024, focusing on both global trends and specific countries.


Challenge/Question: How have global and country-specific surface temperatures changed over the years? Can we predict future anomalies with reasonable accuracy?
